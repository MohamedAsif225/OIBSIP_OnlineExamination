OIBSIP-ONLINE_EXAMINATION TASK-4: 
During my internship, I got to work on creating an online exam system. My job was to build a website where people could take exams securely and smoothly. This meant I had to design how the exam page would look, make sure questions appeared randomly, set up ways for users to log in safely, and keep all the data secure. It was more than just writing basic Java code; I had to learn about web development and how to connect everything to a database. Seeing the project come together, with features like timers for exams and generating results, was really satisfying. It was a big challenge, but I learned a lot and felt proud of what I accomplished.
